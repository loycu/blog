now ,we can compare two method to implement redis client distribute lock.
the first one is jedis,this implement we must use lua script to release lock for avoid release other node lock.
the second is redission,this is a convinient method.it contain tryLock(waitTime ,leaseTime),unlock for a thread.
the redis distribute lock is convinent methond ,the zookeeper is right for strongly consistent with much more nodos.
