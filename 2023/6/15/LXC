  LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features.
  Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create and manage system or application containers.
  The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible to a standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.
